# Titanic Survival Prediction 

This is a machine learning project where I built a logistic regression model to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using Python and scikit-learn.

## Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)
- Features used: Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare, Embarked

## Model

- Logistic Regression
- Achieved accuracy: **X%** on test data
- Evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## Project Files

- `titanic_survival_model.ipynb`: Main notebook with data cleaning, training, and evaluation

## Tools Used

- Python
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- seaborn, matplotlib

##  Next Steps

- Try other models (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest)
- Improve feature engineering
- Deploy as a web app using Streamlit
